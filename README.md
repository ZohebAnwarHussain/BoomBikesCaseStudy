## General Information
- Aim:
	Boom Bikes (a bike lending company) aims to identify which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and how well those variables describe the bike demands
- Background:
	Boom Bikes is a bike-sharing company offering a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
- Business Problem:
	You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
- Provided dataset
	Lending Data available with the company for the years 2018 and 2019.
